# Lead-scoring-case-study
This project is about an education institute.  
Generally people visit the site and just leave. 
Once a visitor fills the form, it is considered as a lead.
The target is to increase the number of leads.
In this project, I have used python libraries like pandas, scikitlearn, matplotlib.
